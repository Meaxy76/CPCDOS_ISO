                            INTRODUCTION
                            ============

NETSHARE.EXE (NetShare) is a utility you can use to easily share
directories and printers in Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS,
version 3.11. NetShare replaces the command-line sharing function
with a user-friendly interface.


                     INSTALLING AND USING NETSHARE
                     =============================

Preparing to Install NetShare
-----------------------------

To successfully use NetShare, you must first enable sharing.

To enable file and/or printer sharing:

1. Change to the Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS directory (usually
   called C:\NET). For example:

      cd\net

2. Type "setup" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

3. Choose Change Setup Options.

4. Choose Change Sharing Options.

5. Choose the type of sharing you want (File, Print, or both).

NOTE: If you try to share a file or printer and sharing is not
enabled, one of the following error messages is displayed:

 - Error 7387: File sharing is not enabled.
                 
   -or-

 - Error 7386: Print sharing is not enabled.

Installing NetShare
-------------------

 - To install NetShare to a hard disk, copy the NETSHARE.EXE file
   into the same directory that contains Workgroup Add-On for
   MS-DOS as follows

      copy <drive>:\netshare.exe <destination>

   where <drive> is the drive and directory from which you are
   copying NETSHARE.EXE and <destination> is the directory
   containing Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS (usually C:\NET).

 - To install to a floppy disk:

   Copy the NETSHARE.EXE file to the root directory of your
   floppy disk.

Using NetShare
--------------

To start NetShare, type "netshare" (without the quotation marks)
at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER. You can use the
following keys and key combinations in NetShare:

                             Current Shares box

Sharing Files
-------------

For sharing files, the following options are available:

Share Name  (Required)  This is the name you assign to a
                        directory on your local hard disk drive.

Path  (Required)        This is the path to the directory you
                        want to share.
                        
                        NOTE: If you share a directory, all of
                        its subdirectories are also shared.
                        You can share local directories only.

Comment  (Optional)     This is a text string you associate
                        with the shared directory to provide
                        information to the person connecting
                        to it.

Re-Share at Startup     If you select this option, the directory
                        specified above is shared each time you
                        log on to the network.

Full Access Password    If you select this option, people
                        connecting to the above share will have
                        full (read/write) access to that share.
                        If you enter a password, they must
                        provide this password to obtain access.

Read-Only Password      If you select this option, people
                        connecting to the above share will have
                        read-only access to that share. If you
                        enter a password, they must provide
                        this password to obtain access.

Share                   Select this option when the Full Access
                        Password, Read-Only Password, and/or
                        Re-Share at Startup options are filled.

Stop Sharing            Select this option if you want to stop
                        sharing a particular directory.

Share Printer           Select this option to share a printer.

Exit                    Choose Exit to quit NetShare and return
                        to an MS-DOS command prompt.

Current Shares          Select this option to list the
                        directories you currently have shared.

The following example demonstrates how to share a directory
called MYWORK and select some of the above options:

1. In the Share Name box, type the following:

      mywork

2. In the Path box, type the path to MYWORK. For example:

      c:\mywork

3. If you want to reshare this directory each time you log
   on to the network, select the Re-Share at Startup option.
   (An "x" should appear in the check box.)

4. Select the type of access (Full or Read-Only) you want
   people connecting to your computer to have, and enter
   a password if you want people to specify this password
   before obtaining access.

5. Select Share, then choose Exit.

Sharing Printers
----------------

Share Name (Required)   This is the name you assign to a
                        directory on your local hard disk
                        drive.

Port (Required)         This specifies the port on which
                        the printer you want to share is
                        located. You can share local
                        printers only. The NetShare utility
                        supports printers connected to
                        parallel ports only.

Comment (Optional)      This is a text string you associate
                        with the shared printer to provide
                        information to the person connecting
                        to it.

Re-Share at Startup     If you select this option, the
                        printer specified above is shared
                        each time you log on to the network.

Password                If you enter a password, people must
                        provide this password to obtain access
                        to your shared printer.

Share                   Select this option if the above
                        options are filled in.

Stop Sharing            Choose this option to stop sharing a
                        particular printer.

Share Dirs              Choose this option to share files.

Exit                    Choose Exit to quit NetShare and return
                        to an MS-DOS command prompt.

Current Shares          Select this option to list the
                        directories you currently have shared.

The following example demonstrates how to share an HP LaserJet 4
printer:

1. In Share Name box, type "HP LaserJet 4" (without the quotation
   marks).

2. Enter the port on which the printer is located.

3. If you want to reshare this printer each time you log on to
   the network, select the Re-Share at Startup option. (An "x"
   should appear in the check box.)

4. Enter a password if you want people to specify this password
   before obtaining access.

5. Select Share, then choose Exit.

Technical Notes
---------------

 - To run NetShare in Microsoft Windows (TM), type the following
   in an MS-DOS session:

      netshare /w

   NOTE: Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS is supported in
   Windows in standard mode only; do NOT attempt to run
   NetShare in 386 enhanced mode.

 - When NetShare loads or when a share is deleted, two
   temporary files are created:

      XNETSHR.TXT and XNETSHR.BAT

   NetShare deletes these files after it is finished using them.

   This process may be slower on floppy disk drives and slower
   computers.

 - NetShare does not work on write-protected disks or read-only
   shared directories. It must be able to create the above
   temporary files in the same directory where it is located.

 - By default, the maximum number of shares in Workgroup Add-On
   for MS-DOS is eight. Perform the following steps to increase
   this number:

   1. Open the SYSTEM.INI file located in the Workgroup Add-On
      for MS-DOS directory (usually C:\NET) in a text editor.

   2. Increase the MAXSHARES setting in the [NETWORK] section
      as follows:

         MAXSHARES=<maximum number of shares>

      For example:

         MAXSHARES=10
 
   3. Save the changes and then restart your computer.
