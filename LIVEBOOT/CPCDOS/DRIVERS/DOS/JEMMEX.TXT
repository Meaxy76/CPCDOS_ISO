JemmEx v5.78 [07/15/12]
JemmEx. Parts (c) tom ehlert 2001-2006 c't/H. Albrecht 1990
usage: either add a line to CONFIG.SYS: DEVICE=JEMMEX.EXE [ options ]
 or run it from the command line: C:\>JEMMEX [ options ]
available options are:
+A20/NOA20     A20-disable emulation on/off (default on)
 A20METHOD:m   set A20 switch method. Possible values for <m> are
               KBC, PS2, BIOS, FAST, PORT92 and ALWAYSON.
 ALTBOOT       use alternate reboot strategy
 B=segm        specify lowest segment address for EMS banking (default=4000)
 D=n           set DMA buffer size in kB (default=64, max is 128)
 EMX           increased EMX DOS extender compatibility
 FASTBOOT      fast reboot. Requires JemmEx to be loaded in CONFIG.SYS.
 FRAME=E000    set EMS page frame (FRAME=NONE disables frame). Any value
               between 8000 and E000 is accepted, but not all will work.
 HMAMIN=n      set minimum amount in Kb to allocate the HMA.
 I=start-end   force a region to be used for UMBs. Without this option
               range C000-EFFF is scanned for unused pages. May also be used
               to add (parts of) regions A000-BFFF or F000-F7FF as UMBs. Don't
               use this option if you don't know what you are doing!
 I=TEST        scan ROMs for unused pages, include found regions as UMBs
 [MAX=]n       limit for VCPI (and EMS if < 32M) memory in kB (default 120 MB)
 MAXEXT=n      limit extended memory usage to <n> kB
 MIN=n         reserve up to <n> kB for EMS/VCPI memory on init (default=0)
 NOCHECK       disallow access to address space without RAM (MMIO)
 NOE801        don't use Int 15h, E801h to get amount of ext. memory
 NOE820        don't use Int 15h, E820h to get amount of ext. memory
 NOEMS         disable EMS handling
 NODYN         no dynamic XMS memory allocation (use MIN= to set fix amount)
 NOHI          don't move resident part into first UMB
 NOINVLPG      don't use INVLPG opcode
+PGE/NOPGE     Page Global Enable feature usage on/off (default off)
 RAM/NORAM     try to supply UMBs on/off (default on)
 S=start-end   assume Shadow-RAM activated by UMBPCI, include it as UMB
 SB            SoundBlaster driver compatibility mode
 SPLIT         regain partially used EPROM 4k pages for UMBs
+VCPI/NOVCPI   VCPI Support on/off (default on)
 VDS/NOVDS     Virtual DMA Services on/off (default on)
+VME/NOVME     V86-Mode Extensions on/off (default on)
 VERBOSE       display additional details during start (abbr: /V)
 X=start-end   exclude region from being touched or used by JemmEx
 X=TEST        scan memory region C000-EFFF for UMB exclusion
 X2MAX=n       max. value in Kb for XMS V2 free memory report (default=65535)
 XMSHANDLES=n  number of available XMS handles (8<=n<=128, default=32)

 '+': option can be set dynamically by running JemmEx from the command line

When invoked from the command line JemmEx additionally will understand:
 LOAD          install
 UNLOAD        uninstall
